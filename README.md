# My Distributed Algorithms "Labs"
"Labs" from my distributed algos course. (These are just distributed algorithms implemented in solidity.) I'm reading Nancy A. Lynch's _Distributed Algorithms._ These algorithms all come from there.

Each folder contains a [Truffle project.](http://truffleframework.com/) You can run the tests with `truffle test`

## LCR
An algorithm for leader election in a synchronous ring network.
## HS
An algorithm for leader election in a synchronous ring network.
